# AGV

This project is part of a bigger project aiming to develop an mcu or sbc based software solution that controls an autonomous vehicle.
It consists of:
  *A cross-platform Xamarin application with a dashboard containing graphs and charts, used for visualizing the state of sensors of an autonomous guided vehicle and for tracking the usage of its resources across time.
  *A mock client that imitates the way the agv communicates with its surroundings using MQTT.
